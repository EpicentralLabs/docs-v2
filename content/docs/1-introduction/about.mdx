## The Mission

Epicentral Labs is building the essential infrastructure to make options trading a reality on the [Solana Blockchain](https://solana.com/) by bringing new decentralized finance derivatives to Solana through the [Epicentral DAO](/docs/2-epicentral-dao).

Our goal is to expand option markets across the ecosystem by developing our flagship product, [OPX](/docs/4-opx), and creating open-source SDKs that empower other protocols to integrate options trading into their own platforms.

## The Core Philosophy

At our core, we want to return financial power back to users from financial institutions. Those who supply the capital that keeps economic systems functioning, should be the ones benefitting the most. Without them, there would be no economy.

Our principles of integrity, decentralization, and strategy drive us towards our end-goals everyday.

### Intended Users
>
> Our focus on opportunity for users is not limited to traders alone. We want to make a protocol and environment where all users within the Solana Network can grow and thrive. — [TheCyberStaker](https://x.com/TheCyberStaker)

## The Problem

Current market opportunities allow traders to profit by either trading at spot price or with leverage via [perpetual futures](https://www.investopedia.com/what-are-perpetual-futures-7494870) (perp trading). 
While this benefits risk-seeking traders, it overlooks key features that enable smarter, more calculated risk-taking.

**Issues traders face when trading with perpetual futures include:**
- Accruing borrow interest on leveraged positions
- Undefined volatility
- Minimal risk management (only offering stop-losses, take-profits, etc.)

All of which hinder the potential growth of traders.

## The Solution

When we put our [Core Philosophy](#the-core-philosophy) into action, options trading helps traders manage excessive risk in today's markets by creating a more structured and predictable trading experience.

**Options are tools that:**
- Mitigate over-exposure to market volatility
- Provide a measurable trading experience with predefined risk and reward
- Offer more advanced risk management strategies
