## The Mission

Our mission to build the necessary infrastructure to make options trading possible on the [Solana Blockchain](https://solana.com/). 
There's no better way to bring new decentralized finance derivatives to Solana than by doing so through our [Epicentral DAO](/docs/2-epicentral-dao).

We plan to expand option market capabilities across the ecosystem by not only building flagship products (OPX) but also creating open-source SDKs for other protocols to integrate options trading into their own products.

## The Core Philosophy

At our core, we want to return financial power back to users from financial institutions. Those who supply the capital that keeps economic systems functioning, should be the ones benefitting the most. Without them, there would be no economy.

Our principles of integrity, opportunity, and strategy drive us towards our end-goals everyday.

### Intended Users
>
> Our focus on opportunity for users is not limited to traders alone. We want to make a protocol and environment where all users within the Solana Network can grow and thrive. — [TheCyberStaker](https://x.com/TheCyberStaker)

## The Problem

Current market opportunities allow traders to profit by either trading at spot price or with leverage via [perpetual futures](https://www.investopedia.com/what-are-perpetual-futures-7494870) (perp trading). 
While this is a great start for traders who are ambitious and enjoy greater risk for even greater rewards, are still missing many key factors that could benefit them more with more calculated risk. 

**As a result, factors like:**
- accruing borrow interest on leveraged positions,
- undefined volatility,
- and minimal risk management (only offering stop-losses, take-profits, etc.),
are all hindering the potential for traders to make smarter trades with predefined risk and reward.

## The Solution

By embracing our [Core Philosophy](#the-core-philosophy), options trading addresses much of today's excessive risk exposure by providing a more structured and predictable trading experience.

**Options are tools that:**
- mitigate over-exposure to market volatility,
- provide a measurable trading experience with predefined risk and reward,
- and offer a more advanced risk management strategies for traders who want to take their trading to the next level.
