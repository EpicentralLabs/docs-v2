## Voting Process

<Steps>
  <Step>

  #### Draft Proposal

  Outline the intent, required resources, and expected outcomes for the idea. This is usually done through a forum post in the Epicentral Labs [Discord](https://discord.gg/5asAuY2sR8) server.

  </Step>
  <Step>

  #### Community Review

  Share the draft for feedback and collect any suggested amendments through the same discord forum post.

  </Step>
  <Step>

  #### Submit On-Chain

  Publish the finalized proposal to the governance program for voting. This is done on-chain through the [Realms](https://realms.today/) user interface. To learn more about how to create a proposal, please visit their documentation [here](https://docs.realms.today/realms-v2/features/proposals).

  #### Vote & Execute

  LABS holders use their LABS to vote directly on live proposals. Voting power depends on how many LABS you hold. Once voting ends, the Core Team carries out approved proposals—or, if possible, the proposal executes automatically via an on-chain instruction.
