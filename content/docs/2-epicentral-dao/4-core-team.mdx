# Core Team — Procedural Agents of the DAO

The **Core Team** operates as the DAO's designated **procedural agents**, performing ministerial and execution-based tasks approved through the [Epicentral DAO](/docs/2-epicentral-dao). Core Team Members do **not** manage, direct, or control the DAO and hold **no discretionary authority** beyond what [LABS Token Holders](/docs/2-epicentral-dao/2-labs-token) explicitly approve. Their role exists to ensure that passed proposals, once ratified, execute faithfully, accurately, and without discretion beyond the approved parameters.

<Callout title="Procedural Capacity">
    The Core Team's authority exists **only in a Procedural Capacity**, as defined in the Operating Agreement. Core Team Members execute governance-approved tasks without discretionary deviation and hold no ownership, managerial rights, or binding authority.
</Callout>

## What the Core Team Doesn't Do

The Core Team does **not**:

* Bind the Company without [DAO](/docs/2-epicentral-dao) approval
* Establish strategic direction
* Influence token value
* Perform managerial or entrepreneurial efforts under Howey jurisprudence

---

## Core Team Responsibilities

Once a proposal passes governance, Core Team Members execute approved tasks within the bounds of the **approved mandate** and **cannot exceed governance-defined parameters**.

| Responsibility Category | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| **Smart Contract Operations** | Implement smart contract deployments and configuration changes after DAO approval. |
| **Protocol Development** | Coordinate protocol development, audits, and infrastructure integration |
| **External Communications** | Represent the DAO in communications with third parties |
| **Financial Operations** | Execute approved contributor payments and operational disbursements from the [Core Team Multisig wallet](https://v2.realms.today/dao/J8shg73bobmwaRY2EXsLV3ABytfCTp5uZ2TtVk4aZBfe/proposals) |
| **Community Management** | Administer community operations, including moderation against spam, fraud, or abuse |
| **Documentation** | Publish DAO-approved documentation, releases, and procedural notices |

### Core Team Limitations

**No Core Team Member** may independently:

| Restricted Action | Reserved Authority |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Modify protocol economics | [Epicentral DAO](/docs/2-epicentral-dao) governance |
| Negotiate binding commercial terms | [Epicentral DAO](/docs/2-epicentral-dao) governance |
| Reallocate [DAO Treasury](/docs/2-epicentral-dao) assets | [Epicentral DAO](/docs/2-epicentral-dao) governance |
| Alter governance processes | Operating Agreement |

The [Epicentral DAO](/docs/2-epicentral-dao) expressly reserve these powers.

---

## Core Team Appointment

Under the current framework, the [Epicentral DAO](/docs/2-epicentral-dao) exclusively controls Core Team appointment, addition, and removal.

| Appointment Requirement | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| **Appointment Authority** | The [Epicentral DAO](/docs/2-epicentral-dao) exclusively appoints, adds, or removes Core Team Members |
| **Self-Appointment** | No individual or group may self-appoint or induct new members |
| **Token Status** | Core Team tokens are non-transferable and uniquely tied to multisig roles |
| **Member Status** | Appointment does **not** confer Member status or authority to bind the Company |

### Applicant Requirements

Applicants must demonstrate:

* Technical or operational proficiency
* Consistent participation
* Understanding of the DAO's architecture and requirements
* The ability to execute governance-approved tasks without discretionary deviation

The Core Team structure preserves predictable execution—not strategic control.

## Core Team Budget

The [Epicentral DAO](/docs/2-epicentral-dao) retains **exclusive authority** over the [DAO Treasury](/docs/2-epicentral-dao) and sets the Core Team's operational budget through on-chain governance.

| Budget Stage | Process |
|--------------|---------|
| **Approval** | The DAO sets the Core Team's operational budget through on-chain governance |
| **Transfer** | Funds transfer from the [DAO Treasury](/docs/2-epicentral-dao) to the **[Core Team Multisig wallet](https://v2.realms.today/dao/J8shg73bobmwaRY2EXsLV3ABytfCTp5uZ2TtVk4aZBfe/proposals)** |
| **Execution** | Core Team Members may spend funds **only** as authorized |
| **Modification** | Budget flows cannot be altered without a new governance proposal |

<Callout title="DAO Budget Control">
    Core Team budgets are determined by the [Epicentral DAO](/docs/2-epicentral-dao). Any funds used in a non-procedural way must be approved by the [Epicentral DAO](/docs/2-epicentral-dao). Any funds controlled by the Core Team through the [multisignature wallet](https://v2.realms.today/dao/J8shg73bobmwaRY2EXsLV3ABytfCTp5uZ2TtVk4aZBfe/proposals) can only be allocated by the [Epicentral DAO](/docs/2-epicentral-dao).
</Callout>

<Callout title="Budget Allocation Nature">
    Budget allocations are not salaries, dividends, or profit entitlements; they are compensation for execution-based services performed on behalf of the DAO. This is consistent with **VII.2**, which authorizes Core Team compensation as part of protocol operations.
</Callout>

## Core Team Multisig Wallet

The [Core Team Multisig wallet](https://v2.realms.today/dao/J8shg73bobmwaRY2EXsLV3ABytfCTp5uZ2TtVk4aZBfe/proposals) protects DAO resources by requiring **unanimous approval** from all Core Team signers for every transaction.

| Multisig Feature | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Unanimous Approval** | All Core Team signers must approve every transaction |
| **Individual Protection** | No individual—including founders—may unilaterally transfer funds |
| **Governance Control** | Multisig control cannot be modified without governance approval |
| **Transparency** | Operational disbursements require transparent, verifiable authorization |
| **Oversight** | All spending remains traceable and subject to DAO oversight |

The multisig therefore acts as a **procedural safeguard**, not a governance layer.

---

## Budget Transparency

The DAO maintains **public observability** of Core Team budget execution through comprehensive reporting mechanisms.

| Transparency Element | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| **Audit Trails** | Documented audit trails for every expense |
| **Spending Records** | Categorized spending records |
| **Operating Reports** | Monthly operating reports and financial forecasts |
| **Transaction Tracking** | Real-time tracking of [multisig transactions](https://v2.realms.today/dao/J8shg73bobmwaRY2EXsLV3ABytfCTp5uZ2TtVk4aZBfe/proposals) |

Transparency ensures accountability without granting token holders fiduciary rights or profit expectations.

## Summary

The Core Team structure reinforces decentralization while enabling operational continuity and predictable execution.

| Core Team Characteristic | Description |
|-------------------------|-------------|
| **Decision Making** | Executes governance decisions, but does not create them |
| **Authority** | Holds no ownership, managerial rights, or binding authority |
| **Operational Scope** | Operates strictly within a Procedural Capacity |
| **Compensation** | Receives compensation for labor—not token-based profit rights |
| **Wallet Control** | Functions through a [multisig wallet](https://v2.realms.today/dao/J8shg73bobmwaRY2EXsLV3ABytfCTp5uZ2TtVk4aZBfe/proposals) controlled by unanimous consent |
| **Purpose** | Exists to ensure proposals become reality, not to direct the DAO's future |

This structure reinforces decentralization while enabling operational continuity and predictable execution.
