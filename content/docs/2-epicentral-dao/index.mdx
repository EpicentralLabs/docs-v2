# The DAO

Epicentral DAO ("Epicentral Labs") is the on-chain infrastructure in how Epicentral Labs **operates as a whole**. Most includes, but not limited to: 

- development financing, 
- partnerships, 
- collaborations, 
- payment to contributors, and 
- treasury asset allocations.

Specifically, Epicentral DAO is built on the [Solana blockchain](https://solana.com/) and can be accessed and governed through [Realms](https://realms.today/), the leading open-source platform for DAO creation, governance, and treasury management on Solana.
