# Rewards Token

**xLABS** is the on-chain reward token that the [Staking Lab](/docs/3-staking-lab) issues to participants who stake [LABS](/docs/2-tokens/labs-token) tokens. 
The token serves as a proof-of-stake accounting unit that tracks the length of time a user has staked LABS in the [Staking Lab](/docs/3-staking-lab).

---

# Purpose

Epicentral Labs designed xLABS to separate governance from participation-based compensation. Staking LABS produces xLABS; holding or transferring xLABS allows participants to decide how, when, and if they engage with the [Rewards Program](/docs/3-staking-lab).

    Users mint xLABS solely through the [Staking Lab](/docs/3-staking-lab) when they stake [LABS](/docs/2-tokens/labs-token), following the predetermined emission logic defined in the protocol code. xLABS emissions remain independent from protocol revenue, fee performance, token price, or any other financial metric. Protocol logic mints xLABS regardless of the number of tokens or assets in the Rewards Program pool.

    xLABS functions as a transferable participation credential that quantifies and weighs each user's engagement with [Epicentral DAO](/docs/2-epicentral-dao) governance and other verifiable contributions. Holding xLABS grants no rights or claims to profits, dividends, revenue share, equity, debt, redemption value, or any economic return.

    <Callout>
      The Rewards Program does not create pro-rata, passive, or automatic entitlement to protocol revenue. Each participant must actively engage with the program to access rewards. Merely holding LABS or xLABS never qualifies anyone for distributions, yields, or financial benefits. The Rewards Program exclusively incentivizes engagement rather than investment returns.
    </Callout>

## Why This Structure Exists

The [Epicentral DAO](/docs/2-epicentral-dao) required a mechanism that:

* Recognizes governance participation without implying a capital interest
* Allows users to realize participation-based rewards without selling LABS
* Avoids investment-return expectations, dividend-like language, or buyback semantics
* Maintains compliance with U.S. securities jurisprudence and the Howey Test by eliminating reliance on the managerial efforts of others, profit guarantees, or redemption rights

## How xLABS Works

```
Stake LABS → Receive xLABS → Use or transfer xLABS as desired
```

<Accordions type="multiple">
  <Accordion title="Minting" value="minting">
    When participants stake LABS through the [Staking Lab](/docs/3-staking-lab), the [Staking Program](/docs/3-staking-lab/staking-program) mints xLABS at an emission rate that the [Epicentral DAO](/docs/2-epicentral-dao) sets through the [Realms governance platform](/docs/2-epicentral-dao). The [Reward Calculation System](/docs/3-staking-lab/staking-program/2-reward-calculation-system) determines the amount of xLABS that participants can claim based on their staked amount and time staked.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Holding" value="holding">
    Stakers retain full governance power because their LABS remain staked and under their custodial control.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Transferability" value="transferability">
    xLABS may be transferred, sold, or swapped without unbinding governance power.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Termination" value="termination">
    When participants unstake LABS, the [Staking Program](/docs/3-staking-lab/staking-program) halts xLABS minting. There is no cooldown period for unstaking, and users may stake again at any time.
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

### What xLABS Is Not

xLABS is not:

* A dividend
* An equity interest
* A buyback instrument
* An investment contract
* Evidence of profit rights or revenue ownership

The [Epicentral DAO](/docs/2-epicentral-dao) expressly prohibits classification of xLABS as any of the above, and it does not repurchase xLABS from holders.

| **Symbol**         | xLABS                                                                                                            |
| **Token Address**  | [FILL]        |
| **Initial Supply** | 0 – The protocol creates xLABS exclusively through staking events; it begins with no tokens in circulation.      |
| **Maximum Supply** | Unlimited – The [Staking Program](/docs/3-staking-lab/staking-program) mints xLABS dynamically as users stake.    |
| **Decimals**       | 9                                                                                                                |
| **Emission Rate**  | Adjustable by [Epicentral DAO](/docs/2-epicentral-dao) via [Realms governance platform](/docs/2-epicentral-dao).  |

## Allocations

xLABS has no pre-allocated supply or vesting schedules. The [Staking Program](/docs/3-staking-lab/staking-program) mints the token dynamically as participants stake LABS tokens through the [Staking Lab](/docs/3-staking-lab). The [Epicentral DAO](/docs/2-epicentral-dao) determines and adjusts the emission rate through [governance proposals](/docs/2-epicentral-dao/1-governance-process).
