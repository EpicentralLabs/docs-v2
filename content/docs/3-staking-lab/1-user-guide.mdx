# Minting

<Steps>
    <Step>
        ### Mint xLABS

        Minting xLABS depends largely on the amount of LABS you have staked and the protocol-set **Emission Rate.** 
        This happens over time where the longer you stake, the more xLABS you can mint. This is calculated autonomously using the [Reward Calculation System](/docs/3-staking-lab/staking-program/2-reward-calculation-system) defined in the Staking Program.
        
        ![Mint xLABS](/staking-lab/sl-ug-11.png)

        <Callout title="Minting xLABS" type="warning">
          xLABS are only **minted** after you have "**Claimed**".
        </Callout>

        <Callout title="No Minting Fees">
          **No protocol fees** are taken when **minting** xLABS.
        </Callout>
    </Step>
</Steps>

# Claiming

<Steps>
    <Step>
        ### Claiming xLABS

        Click the "**Claim xLABS**" button to claim your xLABS tokens.

        ![Claim xLABS](/staking-lab/sl-ug-12.png)
        
        <Callout title="No Claiming Fees">
          **No protocol fees** are taken when **claiming** xLABS.
        </Callout>
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Confirm Transaction

        Here you can input the amount of xLABS you want to Claim (or click your available balance to claim all).

        ![Confirm Transaction](/staking-lab/sl-ug-13.png)

        <Callout title="Numerical Mismatch">
          When claiming, you may notice **a numerical mismatch between the amount of xLABS you see in your simulated transaction versus the amount of xLABS you actually receive**. 
          This is because during the claiming process (signing and approving the transaction), they are still being accumulated so that by time of execution, there is a positive mismatch.
        </Callout>
    </Step>
</Steps>

# Redeem Rewards

Redeeming Rewards is done using xLABS. It is the process of **spending your xLABS** to redeem rewards from the **Reward Pool**.

*This is a feature still in development and will be available closer to the launch of OPX on mainnet.*
