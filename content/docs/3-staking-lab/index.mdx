## Core Functionality

The Staking Lab is a platform that allows you to stake **LABS** governance tokens to mint (generate) **xLABS** tokens. **xLABS** can then be *redeemed* for rewards (in SOL) from the **Reward Pool**.

The **Emission Rate** (otherwise known as the rate at which xLABS are minted) is determined by the [Epicentral DAO](/docs/2-epicentral-dao). 

### Staking

Staking is the process of depositing tokens into a protocols on-chain program to incentivize participation in the protocol.

## FAQs

### Do my tokens get locked?

Nope. You may withdraw your tokens at any time.
