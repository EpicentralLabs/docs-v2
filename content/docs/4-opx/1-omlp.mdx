# Option Margin Liquidity Pool (OMLP)

OMLP uses a two-tiered **SAP** system that first draws liquidity from our in-house provider pools, called "[SAP-1](/docs/4-opx/1-omlp#sap-1)." When traders fully utilize SAP-1 funds, the system then sources liquidity from external providers, known as "[SAP-2](/docs/4-opx/1-omlp#sap-2)."

## Single-Asset Pools (SAPs)

**SAPs** are pools that **represent only one underlying asset**. **Liquidity Providers** can deposit the underlying asset to Lend funds to Option Sellers, creating margin for them to trade. For a token to be tradable on [OPX](/docs/4-opx), there must be a SAP for it.
