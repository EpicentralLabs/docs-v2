# Option Margin Liquidity Pool (OMLP)

**Single-Party, Margin-Enabled Options via Smart Contract Liquidity**

## Overview

The **Option Margin Liquidity Pool (OMLP)** is a programmable, non-custodial liquidity architecture that enables users to access margin for options trading without relying on a traditional two-party negotiation. The protocol routes borrowing demand to a pool of liquidity providers, thereby allowing traders to construct options positions independently while liquidity providers earn participation-based fees for enabling those trades.

The OMLP introduces a **single-party approach to options execution**, removing the dependency on locating a counterparty before entering an options contract. Instead of a trader requiring a seller to assume risk, the OMLP supplies margin liquidity on-demand through smart contracts governed by the [Epicentral Labs DAO](/docs/2-epicentral-dao).

<Callout title="Key Innovation">
    The OMLP transforms traditional bilateral options trading into a single-party system where traders interact with liquidity pools rather than individual counterparties, enabling autonomous options creation on [OPX](/docs/4-opx).

## Traditional Options vs. OMLP Options

### Traditional Structure

Historically, every options contract involves two sides:

* **A buyer** seeking optionality
* **A seller** assuming the obligation

This bilateral model often results in:

* Latency in matching counterparties
* Pricing inefficiencies
* Limited market access for non-expert participants

### OMLP Structure: The Single-Party Paradigm

The OMLP replaces the seller with a **liquidity source**, enabling the trader to define key contract parameters—including expiration date and strike price—without coordinating with another human participant.

```
Traditional → Trader A vs Trader B  

OMLP       → Trader A vs Liquidity Pool (SAP)
```

This evolution decentralizes the options selling role and transforms liquidity providers into passive enablers of margin rather than discretionary counterparties.

## Two-Tier Liquidity Architecture

The OMLP utilizes a **dual-tier Single-Asset Pool (SAP) system**, which optimizes capital efficiency, ensures deep liquidity, and minimizes exposure to third-party risk.

<Callout title="Single-Asset Pools (SAPs)">
    Single-Asset Pools (SAPs) represent only one underlying asset. Liquidity providers deposit the underlying asset to enable margin for options trading. For a token to be tradable on [OPX](/docs/4-opx), there must be a SAP for it.
</Callout>

The system operates on a tiered priority basis:

| Tier | Name | Source | Activation |
|------|------|--------|------------|
| **Tier 1** | [SAP1](#sap1-primary-liquidity-layer) | In-house pools governed by [Epicentral Labs DAO](/docs/2-epicentral-dao) | Primary liquidity source |
| **Tier 2** | [SAP2](#sap2-integrated-external-liquidity) | External platforms (Kamino, Orca, etc.) | Activates when SAP1 reaches 95% utilization |

<Accordions type="multiple">
  <Accordion title="Tier 1: SAP1 — Primary Liquidity Layer" value="sap1" id="sap1-primary-liquidity-layer">
    **SAP1** is the in-house liquidity source governed by [Epicentral Labs DAO](/docs/2-epicentral-dao). Liquidity providers deposit assets into SAP1 and receive participation-based fees derived from borrowing activity. These fees are paid in the same asset deposited—no synthetic, wrapped, or secondary reward token required.

    **Example:**

    SOL deposits into a SOL SAP1 pool produce SOL-denominated fee accrual for liquidity providers.

    SAP1:

    * Enables non-traders to participate in options markets
    * Drives Total Value Locked (TVL) growth
    * Avoids impermanent loss exposure by operating as a single-asset structure
    * Prioritizes capital usage before external integrations

    Once SAP1 reaches **100% utilization**, [SAP2](#sap2-integrated-external-liquidity) activates.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tier 2: SAP2 — Integrated External Liquidity" value="sap2" id="sap2-integrated-external-liquidity">
    **SAP2** sources liquidity from established Solana-based liquidity platforms such as **Kamino** and **Orca**. SAP2 guarantees continuous margin availability when [SAP1](#sap1-primary-liquidity-layer) liquidity is fully borrowed, preventing service interruptions and ensuring 24/7 options execution.

    SAP2:

    * Acts as an overflow system
    * Maintains uninterrupted borrowing capacity
    * Expands the OMLP's operational depth beyond native liquidity

    This tiered sequence ensures that Epicentral Labs retains governance control over liquidity prioritization while leveraging proven external providers for scalability.
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Token Eligibility

The [Epicentral Labs DAO](/docs/2-epicentral-dao) determines which assets qualify for borrowing through [SAP1](#sap1-primary-liquidity-layer) and [SAP2](#sap2-integrated-external-liquidity). Eligibility is established through on-chain [governance proposals](/docs/2-epicentral-dao/1-governance-process), ensuring that the community—not any individual—selects supported tokens.

<Callout title="Governance Control">
    Token eligibility decisions require community approval through the [Epicentral Labs DAO governance process](/docs/2-epicentral-dao/1-governance-process). [LABS token](/docs/2-epicentral-dao/2-labs-token) holders vote on which assets become eligible for trading on the [OPX protocol](/docs/4-opx).
</Callout>

Details regarding token qualification criteria are available in the **Token Eligibility** section of the [OPX documentation](/docs/4-opx).

## Impact and Market Innovation

The OMLP introduces a structural redesign to the options market:

* **Retail lenders gain first-time access** to options exposure without requiring options trading expertise
* Traders execute options positions autonomously through the [OPX platform](/docs/4-opx)
* Liquidity providers earn deterministic, participation-based fees without exposing deposits to impermanent loss
* The market gains a **third role** beyond buyer and seller: **the lender**

**Buyer → Lender → Seller abstraction** transforms the traditional options workflow into a modular, composable system compatible with decentralized finance.

The result is a scalable options infrastructure that delivers capital efficiency, user-sovereign execution, and continuous market access—all without centralized order routing, custodial control, or discretionary managerial intervention.

## Summary

**The Option Margin Liquidity Pool enables:**

* Single-party options creation
* Programmable margin sourcing
* Non-custodial liquidity deployment
* Decentralized selection of eligible tokens through [Epicentral Labs DAO governance](/docs/2-epicentral-dao)
* Participation opportunities for traders and liquidity providers alike

The OMLP unlocks a form of options engagement previously unavailable to retail users and redefines how counterparties interact within decentralized derivatives markets. This innovation is central to the [OPX protocol's](/docs/4-opx) mission of making options trading accessible, efficient, and decentralized.
