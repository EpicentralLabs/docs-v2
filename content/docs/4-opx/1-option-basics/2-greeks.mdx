# "Greeks"

["**Greeks**"](https://www.investopedia.com/trading/getting-to-know-the-greeks/) are mathematical gauges that calculate the price of an option contract.

This **Options Trading Basics** guide covers definitions and showcases some examples.

## Composition of an Option

An option's price changes based on how traders interact with it and on market conditions. The composition or structure of an option relies heavily on Greeks. Traders use Greeks to understand how various factors affect [option pricing](/docs/4-opx/1-option-basics) and to make informed trading decisions.

## Δ - Delta

Delta measures how much the option's price changes with every $1 change in the underlying token's price. Delta helps traders understand how [call options](/docs/4-opx/1-option-basics/1-calls-and-puts#long-call-option-bullish) and [put options](/docs/4-opx/1-option-basics/1-calls-and-puts#long-put-option-bearish) respond to price movements in the underlying asset.

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Definition** | Measures price sensitivity to underlying token price movements |
| **Calculation** | Change in option price per $1 change in underlying token price |
| **Range** | Typically between 0 and 1 for calls, -1 and 0 for puts |
| **Interpretation** | Higher deltas indicate the option's price closely follows the token's price movements |

<Callout>
    Higher deltas indicate the option's price closely follows the token's price movements.
</Callout>

## Γ - Gamma

Gamma tracks how much delta changes when the underlying token's price changes by $1, reflecting the sensitivity of delta.

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Definition** | Measures the rate of change of delta |
| **Calculation** | Change in delta per $1 change in underlying token price |
| **Range** | Always positive (for both calls and puts) |
| **Interpretation** | Higher gamma means delta will adjust quickly with token price movements |

<Callout>
    Higher gamma means delta will adjust quickly with token price movements.
</Callout>

## Θ - Theta

Theta represents the option's time decay, showing how much value the option loses each day as the [expiration date](/docs/4-opx/1-option-basics#terminology) approaches. Theta quantifies the time value component of an option's [premium](/docs/4-opx/1-option-basics#terminology).

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Definition** | Measures time decay—the rate at which option value decreases over time |
| **Calculation** | Change in option price per day as expiration approaches |
| **Range** | Typically negative (options lose value over time) |
| **Interpretation** | A high theta means the option's value decreases faster with time |

<Callout>
    Sellers prefer high thetas because they earn more from the buyer as time passes.
</Callout>

## ν - Vega

Vega measures the sensitivity of the option's price relative to changes in the underlying token's [volatility](/docs/4-opx/1-option-basics#terminology). Vega helps traders understand how market uncertainty affects option pricing.

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Definition** | Measures sensitivity to volatility changes |
| **Calculation** | Change in option price per 1% change in implied volatility |
| **Range** | Always positive (for both calls and puts) |
| **Interpretation** | Higher vega means the option's price is more affected by volatility shifts |

<Callout>
    Higher vega means the option's price is more affected by volatility shifts.
</Callout>

## ρ - Rho

Rho indicates how much the option's price changes in response to a 1% change in interest rates. Rho reflects sensitivity to changes in the [risk-free rate](/docs/4-opx/1-option-basics#terminology), which affects the cost of carrying positions.

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Definition** | Measures sensitivity to interest rate changes |
| **Calculation** | Change in option price per 1% change in risk-free interest rate |
| **Range** | Positive for calls, negative for puts |
| **Interpretation** | Higher rho indicates that the option's value is more sensitive to interest rate changes |

<Callout>
    Higher rho indicates that the option's value is more sensitive to interest rate changes.
</Callout>
