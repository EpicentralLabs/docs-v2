# Learning the Foundation

**Options - For Starters** offers a concise introduction to options, covering why traders use them and how Epicentral Labs continues to provide relevant educational content and trading strategies throughout the documentation.

Epicentral Labs aims to ensure that traders from every background can clearly understand the essentials of options trading.

Let’s begin with the basics!

## Prerequisites

Understanding options can challenge newcomers, especially those who have not encountered these concepts before. The introductory guides in this section help provide a general framework for how derivatives trading functions.

To measure readiness, every trader should be able to clearly explain the following core concepts:

| Concept        | Brief Description |
|----------------|------------------|
| Bid/Ask        | The price a buyer is willing to pay (bid) versus the price a seller asks. |
| Bullish/Bearish or Long/Short | Bullish means expecting price increase (long); bearish means expecting price decrease (short). |
| Market Order   | An order to buy/sell immediately at current market prices. |
| Limit Order    | An order to buy/sell at a specified price or better. |
| Stop-Loss Order| An order that automatically sells or buys once price hits a specific threshold, minimizing possible loss. |
| Hedging        | Using financial instruments to reduce potential losses. |
| Financial Derivatives | Contracts whose value is based on the performance of an underlying asset. |

## What are Options?

Option contracts act as financial derivatives for an underlying asset or token. An option represents an agreement between a **buyer** and a **seller** to potentially transact at a predetermined date (the expiration date) and price (the **strike price**).

<Accordions type="single" className="my-4">
  <Accordion title="How are Options Used?" value="basic-usage">
    <p>Traders use options primarily for price speculation, for hedging positions, and for generating additional income.</p>
    <p>Traders may also combine multiple contracts—referred to as "legs"—to create complex spread positions and manage portfolio risks.</p>
    <Callout title="Options Versatility">
      Options offer both flexibility and diversity, enabling traders and investors to further diversify their strategies and manage market exposure.

## Options: Traditional Finance (TradFi) vs Decentralized Finance (DeFi)

Options trading and options pricing are now accessible permissionlessly on-chain. On [OPX](/docs/4-opx), smart contracts handle the underwriting and dynamic pricing of DeFi options.

<Accordions type="single" className="my-4">
  <Accordion title="Quantity: TradFi vs DeFi" value="quantity">
    <p><strong>In TradFi:</strong> Options are traded on centralized exchanges or OTC markets, generally routed through clearing houses. Each traditional contract typically represents <strong>100x</strong> shares of the underlying and is not adjustable.</p>
    <p><strong>In DeFi:</strong> Smart contracts enable fractionalization and flexible contract sizes.</p>

</Accordions>

<Accordions type="single" className="my-4">
  <Accordion title="Naked vs Covered Options" value="naked-covered">
    <p><strong>TradFi:</strong> Sellers may write "naked" contracts, in which they do not possess the underlying asset. This exposes them to potentially unlimited losses, which persist until the contract expires, is sold, or executed by the buyer. While this offers buyers significant upside, it can be emotionally and financially devastating for the seller.</p>
    <Callout>
      For example: when the market moves against a naked seller, the financial losses may only stop at contract expiry, sale, or execution by the option holder.
    </Callout>
    <p><strong>DeFi:</strong> Protocols restrict naked options as a preventative measure against systemic risk. Since there is no centralized enforcement for margin calls, smart contracts ensure all written positions are fully "cash covered" (collateralized). This limits the seller's maximum loss to the supplied collateral.</p>
    <Callout>
      For example: a seller's losses stop once the posted collateral hits zero, the contract expires, or the buyer acts.

## TradFi vs DeFi: The Summary

In summary, options trading in TradFi and DeFi shares a common foundation, but DeFi introduces new mechanisms, risks, and opportunities. Both approaches remain integral to modern trading. Many financial institutions monitor options markets as a key sentiment indicator for underlying assets. Epicentral Labs continues working to lower the barrier to entry for all participants so that more traders can benefit from options trading.

## Terminology

<Accordions type="single" className="my-4">
