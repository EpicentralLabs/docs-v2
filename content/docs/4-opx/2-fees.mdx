# Overview

OPX collects protocol-level fees when users open, close, or interact with options contracts and related platform features. These fees compensate ecosystem participants and fund continued protocol development, consistent with the non-custodial reward and operational models defined in the [Epicentral Labs DAO](/docs/2-epicentral-dao) governance framework.

These fees are not investment returns, dividends, or profit-sharing mechanisms and do not imply ownership or entitlement to the protocol. Fee structures are transparent and displayed within the interface during position creation and management.

# Revenue Allocation

OPX distributes all collected fees autonomously through smart contract logic. The protocol allocates fees according to the following structure:

| Allocation Category | Percentage | Description |
|---------------------|:----------:|-------------|
| [Rewards Program](/docs/3-staking-lab) | 70% | Claimable Funds allocated to the Rewards Pool intended to incentivize participation and contributions from LABS Token holders |
| Core Team | 20% | Compensation for ongoing development, maintenance, and operational labor |
| Operations Expenses | 10% | Platform maintenance, infrastructure costs, and approved operational expenditures |

<Callout title="Autonomous Distribution">
    OPX distributes all fees autonomously through deterministic smart contract logic. The protocol executes fee allocation automatically without requiring manual intervention or discretionary management.
</Callout>

<Accordions type="multiple">
  <Accordion title="Rewards Program — 70%" value="rewards-program">
    OPX allocates up to seventy percent (70%) of its protocol-designated incentive budgets directly to the <a href="/docs/3-staking-lab">Rewards Program</a>. These allocations exclusively support the ongoing operation of the Rewards Program. They do not establish, collateralize, or backstop the value of <a href="/docs/2-epicentral-dao/3-xlabs-token">xLABS</a>.

    The protocol mints xLABS solely through the <a href="/docs/3-staking-lab">Staking Lab</a> when participants stake <a href="/docs/2-epicentral-dao/2-labs-token">LABS</a>, following the predetermined emission logic defined in the protocol code. xLABS emissions remain independent from protocol revenue, fee performance, token price, or any other financial metric. Protocol logic mints xLABS regardless of the number of tokens or assets in the Rewards Program pool.

    xLABS functions as a transferable participation credential that quantifies and weighs each user's engagement with <a href="/docs/2-epicentral-dao">Epicentral Labs DAO</a> governance and other verifiable contributions. Holding xLABS grants no rights or claims to profits, dividends, revenue share, equity, debt, redemption value, or any economic return.

    The protocol restricts access to the Rewards Program pool to users who satisfy specific participation requirements. OPX makes no guarantee regarding the amount of assets in the pool at any time and does not guarantee that xLABS holders can redeem a predetermined value, quantity, or share of protocol fees.

    Redemption eligibility and amounts change dynamically based on user participation, timing, and the pool's state at redemption. Neither <a href="/docs/2-epicentral-dao">Epicentral Labs DAO</a>, OPX, nor any related party commits to or assures the future pool value or assets claimable by xLABS holders. All redemptions are discretionary, conditional, and subject to nondeterministic protocol rules.

    The Rewards Program does not create pro-rata, passive, or automatic entitlement to protocol revenue. Each user must actively participate to access rewards; merely holding LABS or xLABS never entitles a holder to distribution, yield, or any financial benefit. The Rewards Program strictly incentivizes engagement, not investment returns.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Core Team — 20%" value="core-team">
    OPX allocates twenty percent (20%) of all collected fees to Core Team compensation, supporting ongoing development, maintenance, and operational labor. This allocation reflects the Core Team's responsibilities and follows the permissions set by the <a href="/docs/2-epicentral-dao">Epicentral Labs DAO</a> governance framework.

    This allocation is not a royalty based on token ownership, investment performance, or managerial actions. OPX compensates Core Team members for protocol-related work as approved through the <a href="/docs/2-epicentral-dao">Realms governance mechanism</a>. The Core Team utilizes these funds in a Procedural Capacity only and may not use them for speculation or to influence token value.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Operations Expenses — 10%" value="operations-expenses">
    OPX assigns ten percent (10%) of all collected fees to operational overhead, covering:
    <ul>
      <li>Platform maintenance</li>
      <li>Infrastructure costs</li>
      <li>Approved operational expenditures</li>
    </ul>
    These funds ensure reliable platform operations and continued protocol development. The protocol reserves these funds solely for operational use and will not apply them for speculation or token price influence.
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

None of these allocations represent token repurchases, token price support, or financial returns. They do not affect the rights or limitations of <a href="/docs/2-epicentral-dao/2-labs-token">LABS</a> or <a href="/docs/2-epicentral-dao/3-xlabs-token">xLABS</a> holders.

# User Fees

OPX charges fees based on user actions and position types. The protocol applies fees transparently, and users see all applicable fees displayed within the interface during position creation and management.

<Callout title="Close Position Fee Responsibility">
    The Buyer or Seller that initiates the close position order pays the close fee.
</Callout>

### Buyer Fees

Buyers incur fees upon executing economically meaningful events rather than holding positions, consistent with non-custodial platform design.

| Action | Fee Type |
|--------|----------|
| Bid Open Position | 0.02 SOL fixed rate |
| Contract Premium | No fee charged |
| Bid Close Position | 0.10% of realized PnL |
| Exercise Option | 0.25% of position size |

Buyers pay no fee on contract premiums received from sellers. The protocol charges buyers only for actions that consume platform resources or execute position changes.

### Seller Fees

Sellers incur fees based on their role in creating and managing options contracts. Contract originators (First Makers) receive preferential treatment to incentivize market creation.

| Action | Fee Type |
|--------|----------|
| Ask Open Position (First Maker) | Free — No fee for creating a new option contract |
| Ask Open Position (Existing Option Chain) | 0.02 SOL fixed rate — Fee applies when utilizing an existing contract template |
| Seller Borrow Rate | 0.005% – 0.02% per hour, based on position size and indexed to utilization inside the [OMLP](/docs/4-opx/1-omlp) |
| Ask Close Position | 0.075% of realized PnL — Sellers receive a 25% discount on close fees |
| Seller Liquidation | 0.10% of collateral size |

<Callout title="Partial Position Closures">
    When a Seller closes only part of their position, the protocol fractionalizes participant Buyers' positions based on the quantity of option contracts remaining for that Seller's position. The protocol only closes out Buyers completely if the Seller closes their entire position.
</Callout>

Sellers benefit from reduced fees when creating new option contracts, encouraging market depth and liquidity provision. The protocol charges sellers for borrowing from the [OMLP](/docs/4-opx/1-omlp) based on utilization rates and position size.

## Platform Swap Convenience Fee

OPX charges a convenience fee for platform swap functionality:

| Action | Fee Type |
|--------|----------|
| Platform Swap Convenience | 0.10% of position size |

This fee applies when users utilize OPX's integrated swap functionality for position management.
