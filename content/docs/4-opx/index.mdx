OPX is a decentralized options exchange protocol and serves as the flagship product at the core of the platform. Through OPX, users can directly enter and exit option positions, enabling active management of profit and loss.

The essence of OPX is defined by three words:

- <span style={{ color: "#4a85ff" }}><strong>Design</strong></span>
- <span style={{ color: "rgb(219, 74, 255)" }}><strong>Experience</strong></span>
- <span style={{ color: "#4a85ff" }}><strong>Simplicity</strong></span>

While options trading is often considered complex and intimidating, OPX is designed to remove such barriers. The intuitive user interface empowers traders of any experience level to trade confidently, including those new to options.

## Trade Page: For Buyers

OPX provides two distinct trading interfaces for buyers: **Degen Mode** and **Pro Mode**. The following describes the Pro Mode. Those seeking a lighter trading experience should refer to the [Degen Mode](/products/degen-mode) page.

The default trading interface presents all essential information—option values, strike prices, expiration dates, and clearly organized option [“Greeks”](/options-for-starters/the-greeks). This setup allows quick access to necessary data with minimal clutter, ensuring users can seamlessly track their positions.

Buyers select from live positions created by sellers and can customize trade sizes thanks to DeFi's use of [fractionalized shares](/option-standard-sdk/opm#fractionalized-options-for-buyers-and-sellers):

> For example:
>
> - Quantity: 1 → 100× of the underlying asset
> - Quantity: 0.5 → 50× of the underlying asset
> - Quantity: 0.25 → 25× of the underlying asset

## Option Lab: For Sellers

Sellers utilize one of two versions of the Option Lab to write new options contracts.

When creating a contract, the interface guides the user through three clear steps:
- Configure
- Provide Collateral
- Review & Mint

### Configure Option

The process begins by specifying the fundamental parameters: Strike Price, Expiration Date, and Quantity.

Additionally, an “Advanced Option Details” section provides deeper context regarding the position, including values such as Implied Volatility, Risk-Free Rate, Moneyness, and Estimated Max Profit. Full definitions are available in the [Terminology](/options-for-starters/intro#terminology) section.

### Provide Collateral

**Collateral Amount Panel:** Sellers determine the type and amount of collateral to be contributed to [cover](/option-standard-sdk/opm#no-naked-positions) their position. If more collateral is required, they may borrow the remainder from the [OMLP](/products/omlp), leveraging up to 5× through the leverage panel.

**Collateral Status:** This section displays the current contribution, any additional coverage needed, and the overall coverage percentage.

**Cost Breakdown Panel:** Sellers receive a full breakdown of creation-related costs:
> - Borrow cost (split by day/hour)
> - Maximum Profit Potential
> - Option Creation Fee
> - Transaction cost

This approach provides a comprehensive overview of profit and loss potential before the contract is minted.

### Review & Mint

In the final step, users review all relevant details from previous stages before finalizing and minting the options contract.

## Revenue

OPX applies fees whenever positions are opened or closed.

A comprehensive overview of these fees is available on the [Fees](/products/fees.md) page.
