# OPX

**OPX** is an Options Trading Platform that that lets users create and trade option contracts (derivatives) for Solana tokens.

Users can seamlessly act as traders, market makers, and provide liquidity for market makers on OPX, which unlocks real yield opportunities and advanced risk management strategies — such as: 

- speculation trading (long or short), 
- multi-legged strategies, 
- fractional option contract trading, 
- leveraged market-making opportunities, and 
- liquidity lending pools (OMLP)

The global derivatives market (all types — interest rate, FX, equity, credit, etc) has notional outstanding in the range of hundreds of trillions of USD. 
For example, as of end-2023 the notional amount outstanding in OTC derivatives for interest-rate contracts alone was about USD *$530 trillion*.

## Simplicity > Complexity

Options-trading can be complicated enough creating a high barrier of entry knowledgewise. 
The goal with OPX is to ensure that the user-interface is user-friendly, so that even the first-time options traders can understand.

## Buyers (Takers) & Sellers (Makers)

*Become the player, or become the game.* OPX allows users to either buy options or short-sell options... or both!

### Buyers (Takers)

Buyers (Takers) are the ones who pay the premium to the Seller, to buy the option contract. 
In return, they receive the right to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price (strike price) on or before a specified date (expiration date).

Buyers can:
- Speculate on the direction of the underlying asset
- Hedge against over-exposure based on current and historical market volatility
- Bet with the market sentiment

### Sellers (Makers)

Sellers (Makers) are the ones who sell the option contract to the Buyer.
In return, they receive the premium from the Buyer. They are also known as "option writers" or "option sellers". 
They are the ones who are willing to sell the option contract at a predetermined price (strike price) on or before a specified date (expiration date) to collect the premium over time (known as "Theta" or "time value" of the option).

Sellers can:
- Provide option liquidity to the market by selling the option contract to the Buyer
- Earn from "time-decay" (Theta) of the option premium
- Bet against the typical market sentiment
