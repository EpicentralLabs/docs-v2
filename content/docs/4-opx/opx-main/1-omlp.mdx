# Overview

**Option Margin Liquidity Pool (OMLP)** is a programmable, non-custodial liquidity architecture that enables users to access margin for options trading while being cash-covered. This allows lenders to participate in options trading by routing liquidity to seller-side demand.

## Traditional Options vs. OMLP Options

### Comparing Traditional Options and OMLP Options

| Aspect                   | Traditional Options Structure                      | OMLP Structure (Single-Party Paradigm)                   |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Counterparties**       | Buyer and seller                                  | Buyer, Seller, and Lender                     |
| **How contracts are made** | Requires two parties to agree on terms             | Requires two parties to agree on terms (allows for third party involvement) |
| **Role of liquidity**    | Seller provides margin and assumes full obligation | 	Seller provides margin and assumes full obligation (allows for third party liquidity) |
| **Contract flexibility** | Limited by seller availability and preferences     | 	Limited by seller availability and preferences                   |
| **Trade Execution**    | Executed by custodial agents       | Executed by non-custodial smart contracts |

## Two-Tier Liquidity Architecture

The OMLP utilizes a **dual-tier Single-Asset Pool (SAP) system**, which optimizes capital efficiency, and allows for third-party integration for liquidity scaling.

<Callout title="Single-Asset Pools (SAPs)">
    Single-Asset Pools (SAPs) represent only one underlying asset. Liquidity providers deposit the underlying asset to enable margin for options trading. For a token to be tradable on [OPX](/docs/4-opx/opx-main), there must be a SAP for it.
</Callout>

The system operates on a tiered priority basis:

| Tier | Name | Source | Activation |
|------|------|--------|------------|
| **Tier 1** | [SAP-1](#SAP-1-primary-liquidity-layer) | In-house pools governed by [Epicentral DAO](/docs/2-epicentral-dao) | Primary liquidity source |
| **Tier 2** | [SAP-2](#SAP-2-integrated-external-liquidity) | External platforms ([Kamino](https://docs.kamino.finance/), [Orca](https://docs.orca.so/), etc.) | Activates when SAP-1 reaches **95%** utilization |

<Accordions type="multiple">
  <Accordion title="Tier 1: SAP-1 — Primary Liquidity Layer" value="SAP-1" id="SAP-1-primary-liquidity-layer">
    Users may supply assets to **SAP-1** to enable borrowing activity. 
    The protocol may display a historical annualized rate reflecting prior utilization, and users may receive protocol-determined transfers in the same asset they supplied based on their participation. 
    These transfers are not guaranteed, are not tied to price appreciation or managerial efforts, and do not constitute dividends, yields, or profit rights. No synthetic or secondary reward token is issued.

    <Callout title="Example: SOL Deposit Rewards">
        When a user deposits SOL into a SOL SAP-1 pool, the protocol may provide transfers in SOL determined by the pool's participation parameters.
    </Callout>

    **SAP-1:**

    * Enables non-traders to participate in options markets
    * Drives Total Value Locked (TVL) growth
    * Avoids impermanent loss exposure by operating as a single-asset structure
    * Prioritizes capital usage before external integrations

    Once SAP-1 reaches **100% utilization**, [SAP-2](#SAP-2-integrated-external-liquidity) activates.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tier 2: SAP-2 — Integrated External Liquidity" value="SAP-2" id="SAP-2-integrated-external-liquidity">
    **SAP-2** sources liquidity from established Solana-based liquidity platforms such as [**Kamino**](https://docs.kamino.finance/), [**Orca**](https://docs.orca.so/), etc. 
    SAP-2 allows for extended margin availability when [SAP-1](#SAP-1-primary-liquidity-layer) liquidity is a 95% utilization, designed to avoid service interruptions and allow for 24/7 seller-side liquidity.

    <Callout title="Third Party Historical APR" type="warning">
        SAP-2 historical APR is calculated and determined by third party liquidity providers.  
    </Callout>

## Token Listing Eligibility

The [Epicentral DAO](/docs/2-epicentral-dao) determines which assets qualify for trading on [OPX](/docs/4-opx/opx-main). Eligibility is established through on-chain [governance proposals](/docs/2-epicentral-dao/1-governance-process), ensuring that the community selects supported tokens.

<Callout title="Key Impact & Market Innovation">
  Retail lenders receive direct exposure to options liquidity for the first time, without the need to open their own options positions.

  This approach establishes a scalable options infrastructure that provides capital efficiency, user-sovereign execution, and uninterrupted market access—eliminating centralized order routing, custodial control, and discretionary managerial intervention.

<Callout title="Smart Contract Risk Disclosure" type="warning">
  All participants should understand that interactions with smart contracts involve inherent risks, including potential vulnerabilities, exploits, or loss of funds. Please review the official [Terms of Service](/docs/7-terms-of-service) for full details and disclaimers regarding smart contract risk on OPX.
