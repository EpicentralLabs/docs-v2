# Overview

OPX collects protocol-level fees when users open, close, or interact with options contracts and related platform features. These fees compensate ecosystem participants and fund continued protocol development, consistent with the non-custodial reward and operational models defined in the [Epicentral DAO](/docs/2-epicentral-dao) governance framework.

<Callout>
  These fees are not investment returns, dividends, or profit-sharing mechanisms, and they do not imply ownership or entitlement to the protocol. OPX transparently displays all fee structures within the interface during position creation and management.
</Callout>

# Revenue Allocation

OPX distributes all collected fees autonomously through smart contract logic. The protocol allocates fees according to the following structure:

| Allocation Category | Percentage | Description |
|---------------------|:----------:|-------------|
| [Rewards Program](/docs/3-staking-lab/staking-program/2-reward-calculation-system) | 70% | Claimable Funds allocated to the Rewards Pool intended to incentivize participation and contributions from LABS Token holders |
| Core Team | 20% | Compensation for ongoing development, maintenance, and operational labor |
| Operations Expenses | 10% | Platform maintenance, infrastructure costs, and approved operational expenditures |

<Callout title="Autonomous Distribution">
    OPX distributes all fees autonomously through deterministic smart contract logic. The protocol executes fee allocation automatically without requiring manual intervention or discretionary management.
</Callout>

<Accordions type="multiple">
  <Accordion title="Rewards Program — 70%" value="rewards-program">
    OPX allocates up to seventy percent (70%) of its protocol-designated incentive budgets directly to the [Rewards Program](/docs/3-staking-lab/staking-program/2-reward-calculation-system). These allocations exclusively support the ongoing operation of the Rewards Program. They do not establish, collateralize, or backstop the value of [xLABS](/docs/2-tokens/xlabs-token).
    
    The protocol restricts access to the Rewards Program pool to users who satisfy specific participation requirements. OPX makes no guarantee regarding the amount of assets in the pool at any time and does not guarantee that xLABS holders can redeem a predetermined value, quantity, or share of protocol fees.

    Redemption eligibility and amounts change dynamically based on user participation, timing, and the pool's state at redemption. 
    
    <Callout type="warning">
      Neither [Epicentral DAO](/docs/2-epicentral-dao), OPX, nor any related party commits to or assures the future pool value or the assets that xLABS holders may claim. All redemptions remain discretionary, conditional, and subject to nondeterministic protocol rules.
    </Callout>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Core Team — 20%" value="core-team">
    OPX allocates twenty percent (20%) of all collected fees to Core Team compensation, supporting ongoing development, maintenance, and operational labor. This allocation reflects the Core Team's responsibilities and follows the permissions set by the [Epicentral DAO](/docs/2-epicentral-dao) governance framework.

    This allocation is not a royalty based on token ownership, investment performance, or managerial actions. OPX compensates Core Team members for protocol-related work as approved through the [Epicentral DAO](/docs/2-epicentral-dao). The Core Team utilizes these funds in a Procedural Capacity only and may not use them for speculation or to influence token value.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Operations Expenses — 10%" value="operations-expenses">
    OPX assigns ten percent (10%) of all collected fees to operational overhead, covering:
    <ul>
      <li>Platform maintenance</li>
      <li>Infrastructure costs</li>
      <li>Approved operational expenditures</li>
    </ul>
    These funds ensure reliable platform operations and continued protocol development. The protocol reserves these funds solely for operational use and will not apply them for speculation or token price influence.
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

# User Fees

OPX charges fees based on user actions and position types. The protocol applies fees transparently, and users see all applicable fees displayed within the interface during position creation and management.

<Callout title="Close Position Fee Responsibility">
    The Buyer or Seller that initiates the close position order pays the close fee.
</Callout>

### Buyer Fees

Buyers incur fees upon executing economically meaningful events rather than holding positions, consistent with non-custodial platform design.

<Callout title="Buyer Fee Schedule">
  **The final buyer fee schedule will be determined by an Epicentral DAO governance vote closer to mainnet launch. All information below is illustrative and subject to change. Please monitor [Epicentral DAO](/docs/2-epicentral-dao) proposals for updates.**
