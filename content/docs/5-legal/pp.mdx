# Privacy Policy

## 1. Scope

This Privacy Policy describes how Epicentral Labs, DAO LLC ("Epicentral Labs," "we," "us," or "our") handles information in connection with your use of our **public Interfaces** (websites, dApps, APIs, and smart-contract frontends).

This Policy applies to **general users of the Interfaces**.

Members, Core Team Members, auditors, service providers, and contractors may be subject to **additional confidentiality, data, and record-keeping obligations** under:

* the Operating Agreement;
* Membership Joinder Agreements;
* NDAs or service agreements. 

In case of any conflict between this Policy and those agreements, the latter control for the affected parties.

---

## 2. Data We Collect

Because our Interfaces are **non-custodial and primarily on-chain**, we aim to minimize collection of personal data.

### 2.1 On-Chain and Technical Data

When you use our Interfaces, we may automatically receive:

* **Public blockchain data**, such as your Solana wallet address, transactions you broadcast, and program interactions;
* **Device and browser information**, such as browser type, operating system, and approximate language/locale;
* **Usage analytics**, such as pages visited, time spent, and basic interaction events, via privacy-respecting tools (for example, Plausible or similar) where configured;
* **IP address and approximate geolocation**, to the extent necessary to operate the site, prevent abuse, or implement geofencing and sanctions-screening controls consistent with the Operating Agreement and applicable law. 

### 2.2 Information You Voluntarily Provide

You may voluntarily provide additional information, for example:

* when contacting us by email or form;
* when participating in governance discussions or community channels;
* if you are a Member, Core Team Member, or contractor providing details required for tax or legal compliance (for example, W-9/W-8 forms, legal name, or service address) under Article XII of the Operating Agreement. 

For ordinary users, we **do not require** personal identity documents or legal names to interact with the protocol.

---

## 3. Data We Do Not Collect (for General Users)

For typical use of the Interfaces (e.g., visiting the site and connecting a self-custodied wallet), we do **not**:

* request or store private keys, seed phrases, or wallet passwords;
* intentionally collect traditional financial account numbers (bank accounts, credit cards, etc.);
* require government-issued identification, Social Security numbers, or similar PII **unless** required for a specific regulated service or legal obligation;
* maintain a custodial account or off-chain ledger of your balances.

If you receive payments **directly from the Company** as a contractor, Member, or core contributor, additional information may be required for **tax and reporting** purposes (for example, IRS Forms 1065, 1099, K-1, W-8/W-9), as described in Article XII of the Operating Agreement. 

---

## 4. Cookies and Local Storage

We may use **cookies or local storage** for:

* basic site functionality (for example, language settings, dark mode, UI preferences);
* remembering your wallet connection status or network selection;
* privacy-respecting analytics.

You can disable cookies in your browser, but some minor UX features may not function optimally. Core protocol interactions (on-chain transactions) remain available as long as you can access the front-end and your wallet.

---

## 5. How We Use Information

We may use the information we collect to:

* operate, maintain, and improve the Interfaces;
* monitor protocol usage at an aggregate level (not linked to real-world identities);
* detect, prevent, or respond to fraud, abuse, or security incidents;
* comply with sanctions, AML, and other regulatory obligations (for example, blocking access from certain IP ranges or sanctioned jurisdictions); 
* generate high-level, anonymized metrics for DAO governance and transparency reports;
* fulfill tax, accounting, or legal obligations where Epicentral Labs is required to file information returns or maintain records under U.S. or Wyoming law.

We **do not sell** personal data to third parties.

---

## 6. Sharing of Information

We may share limited information:

* **With service providers** (for example, hosting, analytics, or security vendors) who process data on our behalf under appropriate contractual safeguards;
* **With legal or regulatory authorities**, if required by law, subpoena, court order, or to protect our rights or users;
* **With tax and regulatory bodies**, where required for filings such as IRS or Wyoming state requirements relating to Members or contractors; 
* **With auditors or legal counsel**, as reasonably necessary to obtain professional advice and compliance review.

We do **not** share your private keys or seed phrases with anyone, and we will never ask you to disclose them.

---

## 7. Data Retention

* On-chain data is recorded on the Solana blockchain and is **immutable**; we cannot alter or delete those records.
* Off-chain records (for example, analytics logs, accounting records, Member and contractor documentation) are retained only as long as reasonably necessary:

  * to provide services;
  * to satisfy legal, tax, and regulatory requirements (often at least seven years for accounting/tax records); 
  * to maintain security logs and incident records.

Where feasible, we strive to **aggregate or anonymize** data rather than retain user-identifiable records.

---

## 8. Your Rights (GDPR / CCPA and Similar Regimes)

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information, such as:

* the right to request access to, correction of, or deletion of off-chain personal data we hold about you;
* the right to restrict or object to certain processing;
* the right to data portability.

To exercise these rights with respect to **off-chain** data, you may contact us at:  
**[thelazysol@gmail.com](mailto:thelazysol@gmail.com)**

**Important:** On-chain records cannot be altered or erased by us. Your blockchain transactions are immutably stored on the Solana network and are outside our ability to modify.

---

## 9. Security Measures

We take reasonable measures to protect off-chain information we control, including:

* limiting access to internal systems to authorized personnel;
* using encrypted channels (HTTPS/TLS) for data in transit;
* maintaining private, secure repositories for sensitive member and operational records, including any confidential channels explicitly excluded from public archiving under the Operating Agreement (for example, certain "Support" or "Operations" channels). 

**However:**

* No system is entirely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security of any data transmitted to or from our services.
* You are responsible for securing your own devices, browsers, and wallets.

---

## 10. International Data Transfers

If you access the Interfaces from outside the United States, you understand that information may be processed in the U.S. or other jurisdictions with different data-protection laws than your own.

Where required, we will take steps to ensure an appropriate level of protection, consistent with applicable law.

---

## 11. Children's Privacy

The Interfaces are **not directed to children** under the age of 18, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe that a minor has provided us with personal data, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.

---

## 12. Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do:

* we will revise the "Effective Date" at the top; and
* we may provide notice via our website, governance forums, or Realms references.

Your continued use of the Interfaces after any update constitutes acceptance of the revised Policy.
