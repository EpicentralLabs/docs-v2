## 1.1.0 - 2025-12-26
<ChangelogBadge type="UPDATE" />

**FEATURES:**
- Added user-based claim history tracking (each wallet is now tracked accurately, individually) You *may* see your "xLABS Claimed" value reset (dont worry, its just a database update).
- Added "Governance" link to navigation (Epicentral DAO) and "Epicentral Labs" along with a logo on the top left to help navigate to the main web page.
- Added WebGL fallback for animation compatibility on privacy-focused browsers (this should fix the grey overlay for some browsers. If it still occurs, please ensure that scripts are not blocked - as that is a user-based setting, not browser, open a support ticket if you have issues).

**OPTIMIZATIONS:**
- Refactored the "Pending xLABS" calculation accuracy, (calculates fast, real-time accumulation). xLABS accumulation is now synced properly with on-chain data and UI.
- Improved chart display by removing visible datapoints clogging the line, better time-span options, fixed x-axis dates (added actual dates, not just timestamps), and added % change across all charts.
- Added transaction finalization verification for more accurate claim amounts (Transaction History and notification popups).
- Replaced "Docs" with "How it Works" in navigation for clarity.
