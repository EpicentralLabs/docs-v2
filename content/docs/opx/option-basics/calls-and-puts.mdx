# Option Types

This page covers the basic foundation of **Call Options** and **Put Options**, how they work, and whether going **Long** or **Short** would be beneficial to a trader's position.

## Long Options (Buyer-side)

<Accordions type="single" className="my-6">
  <Accordion title="Long Options" value="long-options-buyer">
    A **Long Options** gives the buyer the right, <em>but not the obligation</em>, to buy the underlying token at a set price, called a <a href="/docs/opx/option-basics#terminology"><strong>Strike Price</strong></a>, within a specific time period.

    <Callout title="Movie Ticket Analogy">
      Purchasing Long Options is like purchasing a movie ticket: When buyers purchase the ticket, they receive the <em>right</em> to enter the theatre.
    </Callout>

    Technically, a buyer who goes Long also has the right to sell the option position outright to exit and realize any gains or losses. There is no requirement to wait until the <a href="/docs/opx/option-basics#terminology"><strong>expiration date</strong></a>.

    <Callout title="Movie Ticket Analogy">
      Buyers have no obligation to stay and watch the whole movie if it is not enjoyable. They can exit the position <em>whenever</em> they desire.
    </Callout>

    For example, if someone buys the <strong>last</strong> movie ticket for a specific showing, that ticket can be <strong>sold</strong> to someone else for profit <em>if</em> desired. Option contracts work the same way: a trader may sell a position to realize profits or losses.

    <Accordions type="single" className="my-4">
      <Accordion title="Long Call Option (Bullish)" value="long-call-bullish">
        A Long <strong>Call</strong> means the trader specifically <strong>purchased a Call Option</strong>, typically representing a <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bullish">bullish</a> stance.

        <div className="relative">

          <img src="/guide-option-basics/Long_Call-DARK.png" alt="Long Call Option PNL Chart" className="hidden dark:block" />
        </div>

        <Callout title="PNL Chart Explanation">
          The <strong>PNL Chart</strong> above provides a generalized sense of a long <strong>call</strong> option when the token price <em>increases</em>. As the value of the token rises, so does the value of the Call Option.
        </Callout>

        Buyers realize profit from the increasing token value without owning the token itself.

        <Callout title="Buyer Risk">
          As an <strong>Option Buyer</strong>, traders limit their risk to the amount they pay as <a href="/docs/opx/option-basics#terminology"><strong>Premium</strong></a> for the option contract.
        </Callout>
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Long Put Option (Bearish)" value="long-put-bearish">
        A <strong>Long Put</strong> means the trader <strong>purchased a Put Option</strong>, usually reflecting a <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bearish">bearish</a> stance.

        <div className="relative">
          <img src="/guide-option-basics/Long_Put-LIGHT.png" alt="Long Put Option PNL Chart" className="dark:hidden" />
          <img src="/guide-option-basics/Long_Put-DARK.png" alt="Long Put Option PNL Chart" className="hidden dark:block" />
        </div>

        <Callout title="PNL Chart Explanation">
          The <strong>PNL Chart</strong> above provides a generalized sense of a long <strong>put</strong> option when the token price <em>decreases</em>. As the value of the token goes down, the value of the Put Option goes up.
        </Callout>

        Buyers realize profit from a decrease in token value without owning the token directly. Put option value generally moves inversely to the token’s price.

## Short Options (Seller-side)

<Accordions type="single" className="my-6">
  <Accordion title="Short Options" value="short-options-seller">
    The "Long Call" and "Long Put" options referenced above represent the **buyer's** perspective.

    Now, let's discuss options from the **seller's** perspective.

    Sellers are [market makers](https://www.citadelsecurities.com/what-we-do/what-is-a-market-maker/)—without them there would be no options contracts to purchase. They are Options Writers who create **Short Options.**

    Unlike buyers—who are **NOT** obligated by the options contract—sellers **ARE** obligated by the options contract.

    <Callout title="Movie Ticket Analogy">
      Selling Short Options is like being a theater owner who sells movie tickets. The owner collects money upfront but must honor the ticket if the buyer shows up—they are <em>obligated</em> to provide entry regardless of how popular the movie becomes.
    </Callout>

    Regardless of the token price, sellers must purchase the underlying token at a specified price **if/when** their option position is **assigned** or expires.

    <Callout title="Option Assignment">
      This is known as [**Assignment**](/docs/opx/option-basics#terminology).
    </Callout>

    Although selling options carries more risk than buying, sellers write contracts because buyers pay them a [**Premium**](/docs/opx/option-basics#terminology) over time. As expiration approaches, the premium earned per hour increases—like a complicated game of ["chicken"](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/play-chicken).

    <Callout title="Movie Ticket Analogy">
      If the buyer chooses not to exercise the option contract, the seller keeps the **full** premium—similar to how a theater owner keeps the ticket price when a customer doesn't show up.
    </Callout>

    <Accordions type="single" className="my-4">
      <Accordion title="Short Call Option (Bearish)" value="short-call-bearish">
        A **Short Call** means traders sell a Call Option. This reflects a bearish stance since traders *anticipate* the underlying token price will *decrease*.

        <Callout title="Movie Ticket Analogy">
          Traders sell the contract with a [**Premium**](/docs/opx/option-basics#terminology) to buyers who anticipate the underlying asset will increase—like a theater owner selling tickets for a movie they expect will be unpopular.
        </Callout>

        <div className="relative">
          <img src="/guide-option-basics/Short_Call-LIGHT.png" alt="Short Call Option PNL Chart" className="dark:hidden" />
          <img src="/guide-option-basics/Short_Call-DARK.png" alt="Short Call Option PNL Chart" className="hidden dark:block" />
        </div>

        <Callout title="PNL Chart Explanation">
          The **PNL Chart** above provides a generalized sense of a short **call** option. As the value of the token increases, the value of the call option decreases.
        </Callout>

        Sellers realize profits from decreasing token value without owning the token itself.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Short Put Option (Bullish)" value="short-put-bullish">
        A **Short Put** means traders sell a Put Option. This reflects a bullish position since traders anticipate the underlying token price will *increase*.

        <Callout title="Movie Ticket Analogy">
          Similar to the Short Call, traders sell a Put Option to buyers and earn the Premium over time if the underlying price *increases*—like a theater owner selling tickets for a movie they expect will be popular.
        </Callout>

        <div className="relative">
          <img src="/guide-option-basics/Short_Put-LIGHT.png" alt="Short Put Option PNL Chart" className="dark:hidden" />
          <img src="/guide-option-basics/Short_Put-DARK.png" alt="Short Put Option PNL Chart" className="hidden dark:block" />
        </div>

        <Callout title="PNL Chart Explanation">
          The **PNL Chart** above provides a generalized sense of a short **put** option. As the value of the token increases, the value of the put option also increases.
        </Callout>

        Sellers realize profits from increasing token value without owning the token itself.
