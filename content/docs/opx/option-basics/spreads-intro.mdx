# Advanced Techniques and Positions for Options Trading

As stated on [Learning the Foundation](/docs/opx/option-basics), fractionalization is key to implementing advanced strategies in options and derivative trading. By maximizing [capital efficiency](/docs/opx/option-basics/index#quantity-tradfi-vs-defi), traders distribute their funds across multiple contracts and positions to increase the odds of profit in their favor—also known as [hedging](/docs/opx/option-basics/index#prerequisites).

Traders create win-win scenarios by utilizing various "**Spread** Strategies."

## Spreads

[Spreads](https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/what-is-options-spread-trade) are used in both TradFi and DeFi options trading. They require combining multiple options (buying and selling different [strike prices](/docs/opx/option-basics#terminology) or [expiration dates](/docs/opx/option-basics#terminology)) to manage cost, risk, or directional bias.

<Callout title="Spreads in Options Trading">
    Traders combine multiple [call options](/docs/opx/option-basics/calls-and-puts#long-call-option-bullish) and [put options](/docs/opx/option-basics/calls-and-puts#long-put-option-bearish) to create spread positions that help manage portfolio risks and optimize capital allocation.
