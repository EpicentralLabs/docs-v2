# Option Pricing Model (OPM)

The **Option Pricing Model (OPM)** serves as the core pricing calculator integrated within the `option_program`. OPM validates option pricing on-chain and forms the foundation for how DeFi options are calculated on Solana.

OPM derives from the widely accepted derivatives formula used in traditional finance—the [Black-Scholes Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes_model#Notation). Both American-style and European-style options stem from this model, making it the optimal candidate for Solana's DeFi options.

## Black-Scholes Model

The [Black-Scholes Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes_model) is a proven and reliable formula that traditional finance uses globally on a daily basis for derivatives pricing. However, using the Black-Scholes model within the DeFi environment presents unique challenges that require adaptation.

## Adapting Black-Scholes for DeFi

Epicentral Labs refactored the original Black-Scholes formula to conform to the Solana DeFi ecosystem. The adaptations include:

### No Naked Positions

All sellers must be ["cash-covered"](/docs/opx/option-basics#naked-vs-covered-options), also known as *"collateralized"*. DeFi protocols restrict ["naked"](/docs/opx/option-basics#naked-vs-covered-options) options as a preventative measure against systemic risk, ensuring all written positions are fully collateralized.

<Callout>
    DeFi protocols require all option positions to be cash-covered (collateralized), limiting the seller's maximum loss to the supplied collateral. This differs from TradFi, where sellers may write naked contracts.
</Callout>

### Fractionalized Options

Traders are no longer obligated to trade 100x of the underlying share per trade. The financial barrier of entry for any given contract is lowered through [fractionalization](/docs/opx/option-basics#quantity-tradfi-vs-defi).

<Callout title="Lowered Financial Barriers">
    Traders maximize their [capital efficiency](/docs/opx/option-basics#quantity-tradfi-vs-defi) by distributing funds across multiple contracts instead of committing to a single position.
</Callout>

Traders mitigate risk by encouraging capital efficiency through the use of [spread strategies](/docs/opx/option-basics/spreads-intro) to create possible win-win scenarios.

## Black-Scholes Pricing Formulas

The Black-Scholes model provides mathematical formulas for calculating call and put option prices.

### Call Option Price

```math
C(S,t) = N(d_+)S_t - N(d_-)Ke^{-r(T-t)}
```

### Put Option Price

```math
P(S,t) = N(-d_+)Ke^{-r(T-t)} - N(-d_-)S_t
```

### Standardized Normal Variables

The formulas use two standardized normal variables:

```math
d_1 = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{T-t}}\left[\ln\left(\frac{S_t}{K}\right) + \left(r + \frac{\sigma^2}{2}\right)(T-t)\right]
```

```math
d_2 = d_1 - \sigma\sqrt{T-t}
```

<Callout>
    The `d1` and `d2` parameters are crucial for the Black-Scholes model, as they determine the option's price and its sensitivity to various factors.
</Callout>

<Accordions type="single" className="my-4">
  <Accordion title="Understanding d1 and d2 Calculations" value="d1-d2">
    The `d1` and `d2` parameters are integral components of the Black-Scholes option pricing model. These parameters determine the theoretical price of options and their sensitivities to various market factors.

    #### d1 Calculation

    The `d1` parameter uses the following formula:

    ```math
    d_1 = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{T-t}}\left[\ln\left(\frac{S_t}{K}\right) + \left(r + \frac{\sigma^2}{2}\right)(T-t)\right]
    ```

    **Parameters:**
    - `spot_price` ($S_t$): The current market price of the underlying asset
    - `strike_price` ($K$): The price at which the option can be exercised
    - `risk_free_rate` ($r$): The annualized risk-free interest rate
    - `volatility` ($\sigma$): The volatility of the underlying asset
    - `time_to_expiry` ($T-t$): The time remaining until expiration, expressed in years

    **Purpose:** The `d1` parameter is a standardized measure that helps determine the probability of option exercise, adjusted for the time value of money and volatility risk premium.

    #### d2 Calculation

    The `d2` parameter uses the formula:

    ```math
    d_2 = d_1 - \sigma\sqrt{T-t}
    ```

    **Parameters:**
    - `d1`: The previously calculated `d1` parameter
    - `volatility` ($\sigma$): The volatility of the underlying asset
    - `time_to_expiry` ($T-t$): The time remaining until expiration, expressed in years

    **Purpose:** The `d2` parameter is used alongside `d1` in the Black-Scholes formula to calculate the option's price. It represents the adjusted probability of the option expiring in-the-money.

  <Callout type="note" title="Note">
    The Solana Options Pricing Model (OPM) for OPX uses historical volatility, not implied volatility, when calculating option prices. Participants should consider this difference when comparing model results to those produced by traditional options markets, where implied volatility is commonly used.

## Option Greeks

The Greeks serve as essential metrics for managing risk in options trading. They help traders understand how their portfolio value changes when specific market factors fluctuate. By analyzing each Greek independently, traders assess individual risk components and adjust their positions to maintain their target risk profile.

An option's price changes based on how traders interact with it and on market conditions. The composition or structure of an option relies heavily on Greeks. Traders use Greeks to understand how various factors affect [option pricing](/docs/opx/option-basics) and to make informed trading decisions.

[*Reference: Wikipedia - Option Greeks*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/en:Greeks_(finance)?variant=zh-tw)

<Accordions type="single" className="my-4">
  <Accordion title="Δ - Delta" value="delta">
    Delta measures how much the option's price changes with every $1 change in the underlying token's price. Delta represents the number of tokens needed to hedge the option and helps traders understand how [call options](/docs/opx/option-basics/calls-and-puts#long-call-option-bullish) and [put options](/docs/opx/option-basics/calls-and-puts#long-put-option-bearish) respond to price movements in the underlying asset.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Θ - Theta" value="theta">
    Theta represents the option's time decay, showing how much value the option loses each day as the [expiration date](/docs/opx/option-basics#terminology) approaches. Theta quantifies the time value component of an option's [premium](/docs/opx/option-basics#terminology) and measures how much value an option loses as time passes.

    ```math
    \Theta = -\frac{\partial V}{\partial \tau}
    ```

    | Aspect | Description |
    |--------|-------------|
    | **Definition** | Measures time decay—the rate at which option value decreases over time |
    | **Calculation** | Change in option price per day as expiration approaches |
    | **Range** | Typically negative (options lose value over time) |
