# Stake LABS. Mint xLABS.
**The Staking Lab** is a platform that allows you to stake **LABS** governance tokens to mint **xLABS** reward tokens. 
**xLABS** can then be *redeemed* for rewards from the **<u>Reward Pool</u>** *(Coming Soon)*.

The Staking Lab documentation is organized into two main sections: **User Guide** for step-by-step instructions on using the platform, and **For Developers** for technical documentation about the Staking Program implementation.
