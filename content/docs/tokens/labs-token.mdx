# Governance & Voting

LABS provides direct on-chain governance capabilities to utility for Epicentral DAO. The DAO operates on a fully democratic basis: community members actively shape the future of the protocol by submitting proposals and casting votes on key initiatives. Members who hold and stake greater amounts of LABS tokens receive increased voting power, rewarding commitment and encouraging deeper alignment with the protocol. This structure ensures that decisions reflect the interests of the most engaged participants.

<Callout title="Voting Power">
    1 LABS Token = 1 Vote Power
</Callout>

LABS token holders are responsible for the following decisions:

- Determining which assets become eligible for trading on the OPX protocol
- Voting on the introduction of new features and improvements to the protocol
- Setting governance parameters and refining the operational structure of the DAO

For details about submitting governance proposals and participating in DAO decisions, see the [governance](/docs/epicentral-dao) page.

All vested allocations utilize on-chain [vesting contracts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vesting.asp), ensuring full transparency and verifiability of token release schedules. 
The protocol implements vesting schedules to ensure long-term alignment of stakeholder interests and prevent immediate sell-offs that could destabilize the token's value. The protocol created all vesting schedules as immutable contracts via [Streamflow](https://streamflow.finance/). 
The vesting contracts are immutable and cannot be modified or canceled. At the time of writing, all vesting contracts are fully distributed. The above is for information purposes only.
