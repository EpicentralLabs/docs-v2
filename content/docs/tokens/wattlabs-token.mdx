description: Optional wrapped version of LABS for enhanced Solana composability

## WATT is wattLABS?
**wattLABS** (powered by [Watt Protocol](https://watt.si/)) is an optional, wrapped version of LABS that offers additional on-chain flexibility without altering the underlying LABS token or its supply. Converting LABS into wattLABS is a reversible, 1:1 process—holders can unwrap back into LABS at any time.

Once wrapped, **wattLABS** can be used across supported Solana applications. This includes providing liquidity on Raydium and connecting to the Watt Protocol, which operates autonomously to balance markets through algorithmic, non-speculative arbitrage.

## The Future of wattLABS?
We aim to enable seamless interaction of **wattLABS** with [The Staking Lab](/docs/staking-lab) to expand composability and utility for both—not to offer profits, dividends, or expectations of financial return. 

In short, wattLABS enhances LABS’ functional reach across Solana without changing what LABS is—preserving its base characteristics while enabling broader, optional utility. 
**wattLABS** simply gives LABS holders more ways to participate in decentralized systems while retaining direct control of their tokens.
